  IMPLEMENTATIONS:
 - 🔥 inclusion of APPRISE library to support many notification services (native PushBullet support has been removed)
   apprise_call (apprise service) apprise_attachment (true/false) notify_lang (DSM lang code) can be additionally defined and overwrite in every YAML rule
 - with value "postscript:" in YAML can be defined post script commands (command or path to script)
 - [YAML] >multilineregex: true< can be set at subrule and for tagname_RegEx
   this will set the parameter -z for grep to find results over multi lines
 - [GUI] support for follow machine translated languages (by DeepL)
    - Korean
    - Norwegian
